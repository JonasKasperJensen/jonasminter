For a long time, Jensen had been playing with the thought on making a visual representation of DAOs. DAO stands for decentralized anonymous organization and is a way to organize people with interests in systems where they must come to an agreement on the condition of the system. As chaotic this might seem, DAOs use code to solve potential disagreements. The painting consists of leftover paint from the entire last year of Jensen’s production and has also served as the fabric surface under his paintings while he worked. Thus it is made from random actions without intention. In Jensen’s mind, this is what a DAO would look like on the surface if not the code could control the interests of the participating individuals.","id":540120205,"materials":"mixed paint on canvas","name":"DAO","size":"110 cm x 140 cm","image":"https://assets.jonaskasperjensen.com/54012020.jpg"}
